Here this shortcut to adiabaticity is cast in terms of a generator of adiabatic transport. This yields a classical analog of transitionless driving, and provides a strategy for constructing quantal counterdiabatic Hamiltonians. As an application of this framework, exact classical and quantal counterdiabatic terms are obtained for a particle in a box and for even-power-law potentials in one degree of freedom.},

	abstract = {Quantum many-body phases offer unique properties and emergent phenomena, making them an active area of research. A promising approach for their experimental realization in model systems is to adiabatically follow the ground state of a quantum Hamiltonian from a product state of isolated particles to one that is strongly-correlated. Such protocols are relevant also more broadly in coherent quantum annealing and adiabatic quantum computing. Here we explore one such protocol in a system of ultracold atoms in an optical lattice. A fully magnetized state is connected to a correlated zero-magnetization state (an xy-ferromagnet) by a many-body spin rotation, realized by sweeping the detuning and power of a microwave field. The efficiency is characterized by applying a reverse sweep with a variable relative phase. We restore up to 50\% of the original magnetization independent of the relative phase, evidence for the formation of correlations. The protocol is limited by the many-body gap of the final state, which is inversely proportional to system size, and technical noise. Our experimental and theoretical studies highlight the potential and challenges for adiabatic preparation protocols to prepare many-body eigenstates of spin Hamiltonians.},

Standard measures of chaos in quantum many-body systems are level statistics and the spectral form factor. In this work, we show that the norm of the adiabatic gauge potential, the generator of adiabatic deformations between eigenstates, serves as a much more sensitive measure of quantum chaos. We are able to detect transitions from integrable to chaotic behavior at perturbation strengths orders of magnitude smaller than those required for standard measures. Using this alternative probe in two generic classes of spin chains, we show that the chaotic threshold decreases exponentially with system size and that one can immediately detect integrability-breaking (chaotic) perturbations by analyzing infinitesimal perturbations even at the integrable point. In some cases, small integrability breaking is shown to lead to anomalously slow relaxation of the system, exponentially long in system size.},

The quantum wave function can sometimes tunnel through significant obstacles. However it can also sometimes get stuck in local minima, even for fairly simple problems. An initial Hamiltonian which insufficiently mixes computational basis states is analogous to a poorly mixing Markov transition rule. We study a physical system -- the Ising quantum chain with alternating sector interaction defects, but constant transverse field -- which is equivalent to applying the quantum adiabatic algorithm to a particular SAT problem. We prove that for a constant range of values for the transverse field, the spectral gap is exponentially small in the sector length. Indeed, we prove that there are exponentially many eigenvalues all exponentially close to the ground state energy. Applying the adiabatic theorem therefore takes exponential time, even for this simple problem.},

The vibronic levels are classified by a quantum number, which in certain cases is formally related to the combined angular momentum of electronic and vibrational motion, and numerical values are obtained for the energies of these levels as functions of this quantum number and a dimensionless parameter measuring the magnitude of the electronic-vibrational coupling. It is shown that the selection rules for transitions from these vibronic levels to those of a non-degenerate electronic state allow changes in vibrational energy of any integral number of quanta, as though the Jahn-Teller effect were equivalent to a distortion which makes allowed vibrational transitions which would otherwise be forbidden. Numerical values are given for the oscillator strengths of vibronic absorption or emission bands involving transitions between a Jahn-Teller distorted state and an electronically non-degenerate state. It is found that in transitions from the latter to the former the vibrational structure of the electronic band exhibits two intensity maxima if the distortion is large.},

If C lies near a degeneracy of Ĥ, γ(C) takes a simple form which includes as a special case the sign change of eigenfunctions of real symmetric matrices round a degeneracy. As an illustration γ(C) is calculated for spinning particles in slowly-changing magnetic fields; although the sign reversal of spinors on rotation is a special case, the effect is predicted to occur for bosons as well as fermions, and a method for observing it is proposed.

While their development is well established in simple systems, their engineering and implementation are challenging in many-body quantum systems with many degrees of freedom. We show that the equation for the counterdiabatic term, equivalently the adiabatic gauge potential, is solved by introducing a Krylov basis. The Krylov basis spans the minimal operator subspace in which the dynamics unfolds and provides an efficient way to construct the counterdiabatic term. We apply our strategy to paradigmatic single and many-particle models. The properties of the counterdiabatic term are reflected in the Lanczos coefficients obtained in the course of the construction of the Krylov basis by an algorithmic method. We examine how the expansion in the Krylov basis incorporates many-body interactions in the counterdiabatic term.},

The space of controllable parameters of isolated quantum many-body systems is endowed with a Riemannian quantum metric structure, which can be exploited when such systems are driven adiabatically. Here, we use this metric structure to construct optimal protocols in order to accomplish the task of adiabatic ground-state preparation in a fixed amount of time. Such optimal protocols are shown to be geodesics on the parameter manifold, maximizing the local fidelity. Physically, such protocols minimize the average energy fluctuations along the path. Our findings are illustrated on the Landau-Zener model and the anisotropic XY spin chain. In both cases we show that geodesic protocols drastically improve the final fidelity. Moreover, this happens even if one crosses a critical point, where the adiabatic perturbation theory fails.},

Such driving in principle allows one to realize arbitrarily fast annealing protocols or implement fast dissipationless driving, circumventing standard adiabatic limitations requiring infinitesimally slow rates. These ideas were tested and used both experimentally and theoretically in small systems, but in larger chaotic systems, it is known that exact counterdiabatic protocols do not exist. In this work, we develop a simple variational approach allowing one to find the best possible counterdiabatic protocols given physical constraints, like locality. These protocols are easy to derive and implement both experimentally and numerically. We show that, using these approximate protocols, one can drastically suppress heating and increase fidelity of quantum annealing protocols in complex many-particle systems.

	abstract = {Whenever a quantum system undergoes a cyclic evolution governed by a slow change of parameters, it acquires a phase factor: the geometric phase. Its most common formulations are known as the Aharonov–Bohm phase and the Pancharatnam and Berry phase, but both earlier and later manifestations exist. Although traditionally attributed to the foundations of quantum mechanics, the geometric phase has been generalized and become increasingly influential in many areas from condensed-matter physics and optics to high-energy and particle physics and from fluid mechanics to gravity and cosmology. Interestingly, the geometric phase also offers unique opportunities for quantum information and computation. In this Review, we first introduce the Aharonov–Bohm effect as an important realization of the geometric phase. Then, we discuss in detail the broader meaning, consequences and realizations of the geometric phase, emphasizing the most important mathematical methods and experimental techniques used in the study of the geometric phase, in particular those related to recent works in optics and condensed-matter physics.},

	abstract = {In these lecture notes, partly based on a course taught at the Karpacz Winter School in March 2014, we explore the close connections between non-adiabatic response of a system with respect to macroscopic parameters and the geometry of quantum and classical states. We center our discussion around adiabatic gauge potentials, which are the generators of unitary basis transformations in quantum systems and generators of special canonical transformations in classical systems. In quantum systems, eigenstate expectation values of these potentials are the Berry connections and the covariance matrix of these gauge potentials is the geometric tensor, whose antisymmetric part defines the Berry curvature and whose symmetric part is the Fubini-Study metric tensor. In classical systems one simply replaces the eigenstate expectation value by an average over the micro-canonical shell. For complicated interacting systems, we show that a variational principle may be used to derive approximate gauge potentials. We then express the non-adiabatic response of the physical observables of the system through these gauge potentials, specifically demonstrating the close connection of the geometric tensor to the notions of Lorentz force and renormalized mass. We highlight applications of this formalism to deriving counter-diabatic (dissipationless) driving protocols in various systems, as well as to finding equations of motion for slow macroscopic parameters coupled to fast microscopic degrees of freedom that go beyond macroscopic Hamiltonian dynamics. Finally, we illustrate these ideas with a number of simple examples and highlight a few more complicated ones drawn from recent literature.},

	abstract = {For a general quantum system driven by a slowly time-dependent Hamiltonian, transitions between instantaneous eigenstates are exponentially weak. But a nearby Hamiltonian exists for which the transition amplitudes between any eigenstates of the original Hamiltonian are exactly zero for all values of slowness. The general theory is illustrated by spins driven by changing magnetic ﬁelds, and implies that any spin expectation history, including those where the spin never precesses, can be generated by inﬁnitely many driving ﬁelds, here displayed explicitly. Asymptotically, the absence of transitions is explained by continuation to complex time, where the complex degeneracies in the transitionless driving ﬁelds have a nongeneric structure for which there is no Stokes phenomenon; this is analogous to the explanation of reﬂectionless potentials.},

	abstract = {Adiabatic protocols are employed across a variety of quantum technologies, from implementing state preparation and individual operations that are building blocks of larger devices, to higher-level protocols in quantum annealing and adiabatic quantum computation. The problem of speeding up these processes has garnered a large amount of interest, resulting in a menagerie of approaches, most notably quantum optimal control and shortcuts to adiabaticity. The two approaches are complementary: optimal control manipulates control fields to steer the dynamics in the minimum allowed time, while shortcuts to adiabaticity aims to retain the adiabatic condition upon speed-up. We outline a new method that combines the two methodologies and takes advantage of the strengths of each. The new technique improves upon approximate local counterdiabatic driving with the addition of time-dependent control fields. We refer to this new method as counterdiabatic optimized local driving (COLD) and we show that it can result in a substantial improvement when applied to annealing protocols, state preparation schemes, entanglement generation, and population transfer on a lattice. We also demonstrate a new approach to the optimization of control fields that does not require access to the wave function or the computation of system dynamics. COLD can be enhanced with existing advanced optimal control methods and we explore this using the chopped randomized basis method and gradient ascent pulse engineering.},

	abstract = {Adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) started as an approach to solving optimization problems and has evolved into an important universal alternative to the standard circuit model of quantum computing, with deep connections to both classical and quantum complexity theory and condensed matter physics. This review gives an account of the major theoretical developments in the field, while focusing on the closed-system setting. The review is organized around a series of topics that are essential to an understanding of the underlying principles of AQC, its algorithmic accomplishments and limitations, and its scope in the more general setting of computational complexity theory. Several variants are presented of the adiabatic theorem, the cornerstone of AQC, and examples are given of explicit AQC algorithms that exhibit a quantum speedup. An overview of several proofs of the universality of AQC and related Hamiltonian quantum complexity theory is given. Considerable space is devoted to stoquastic AQC, the setting of most AQC work to date, where obstructions to success and their possible resolutions are discussed.},

@article{sugiura_adiabatic_2020,
	title = {Adiabatic landscape and optimal paths in ergodic systems},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13735},
	abstract = {Whether one is interested in quantum state preparation or in the design of efficient heat engines, adiabatic (reversible) transformations play a pivotal role in minimizing computational complexity and energy losses. Understanding the structure of these transformations and identifying the systems for which such transformations can be performed efficiently and quickly is therefore of primary importance. In this paper we focus on finding optimal paths in the space of couplings controlling the system's Hamiltonian. More specifically, starting from a local Hamiltonian we analyze directions in the space of couplings along which adiabatic transformations can be accurately generated by local operators, which are both realizable in experiments and easy to simulate numerically. We consider a non-integrable 1D Ising model parametrized by two independent couplings, corresponding to longitudinal and transverse magnetic fields. We find regions in the space of couplings characterized by a very strong anisotropy of the variational adiabatic gauge potential (AGP), generating the adiabatic transformations, which allows us to define optimal adiabatic paths. We find that these paths generally terminate at singular points characterized by extensive degeneracies in the energy spectrum, splitting the parameter space into adiabatically disconnected regions. The anisotropy follows from singularities in the AGP, and we identify special robust weakly-thermalizing and non-absorbing many-body "dark" states which are annihilated by the singular part of the AGP and show that their existence extends deep into the ergodic regime.},
