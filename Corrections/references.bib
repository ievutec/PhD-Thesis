	abstract = {Adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) started as an approach to solving optimization problems and has evolved into an important universal alternative to the standard circuit model of quantum computing, with deep connections to both classical and quantum complexity theory and condensed matter physics. This review gives an account of the major theoretical developments in the field, while focusing on the closed-system setting. The review is organized around a series of topics that are essential to an understanding of the underlying principles of AQC, its algorithmic accomplishments and limitations, and its scope in the more general setting of computational complexity theory. Several variants are presented of the adiabatic theorem, the cornerstone of AQC, and examples are given of explicit AQC algorithms that exhibit a quantum speedup. An overview of several proofs of the universality of AQC and related Hamiltonian quantum complexity theory is given. Considerable space is devoted to stoquastic AQC, the setting of most AQC work to date, where obstructions to success and their possible resolutions are discussed.},

	abstract = {Adiabatic protocols are employed across a variety of quantum technologies, from implementing state preparation and individual operations that are building blocks of larger devices, to higher-level protocols in quantum annealing and adiabatic quantum computation. The problem of speeding up these processes has garnered a large amount of interest, resulting in a menagerie of approaches, most notably quantum optimal control and shortcuts to adiabaticity. The two approaches are complementary: optimal control manipulates control fields to steer the dynamics in the minimum allowed time, while shortcuts to adiabaticity aims to retain the adiabatic condition upon speed-up. We outline a new method that combines the two methodologies and takes advantage of the strengths of each. The new technique improves upon approximate local counterdiabatic driving with the addition of time-dependent control fields. We refer to this new method as counterdiabatic optimized local driving (COLD) and we show that it can result in a substantial improvement when applied to annealing protocols, state preparation schemes, entanglement generation, and population transfer on a lattice. We also demonstrate a new approach to the optimization of control fields that does not require access to the wave function or the computation of system dynamics. COLD can be enhanced with existing advanced optimal control methods and we explore this using the chopped randomized basis method and gradient ascent pulse engineering.},

The general theory is illustrated by spins driven by changing magnetic ﬁelds, and implies that any spin expectation history, including those where the spin never precesses, can be generated by inﬁnitely many driving ﬁelds, here displayed explicitly. Asymptotically, the absence of transitions is explained by continuation to complex time, where the complex degeneracies in the transitionless driving ﬁelds have a nongeneric structure for which there is no Stokes phenomenon; this is analogous to the explanation of reﬂectionless potentials.},

	abstract = {In these lecture notes, partly based on a course taught at the Karpacz Winter School in March 2014, we explore the close connections between non-adiabatic response of a system with respect to macroscopic parameters and the geometry of quantum and classical states. We center our discussion around adiabatic gauge potentials, which are the generators of unitary basis transformations in quantum systems and generators of special canonical transformations in classical systems. In quantum systems, eigenstate expectation values of these potentials are the Berry connections and the covariance matrix of these gauge potentials is the geometric tensor, whose antisymmetric part defines the Berry curvature and whose symmetric part is the Fubini-Study metric tensor. In classical systems one simply replaces the eigenstate expectation value by an average over the micro-canonical shell. For complicated interacting systems, we show that a variational principle may be used to derive approximate gauge potentials. We then express the non-adiabatic response of the physical observables of the system through these gauge potentials, specifically demonstrating the close connection of the geometric tensor to the notions of Lorentz force and renormalized mass. We highlight applications of this formalism to deriving counter-diabatic (dissipationless) driving protocols in various systems, as well as to finding equations of motion for slow macroscopic parameters coupled to fast microscopic degrees of freedom that go beyond macroscopic Hamiltonian dynamics. Finally, we illustrate these ideas with a number of simple examples and highlight a few more complicated ones drawn from recent literature.},

Its most common formulations are known as the Aharonov–Bohm phase and the Pancharatnam and Berry phase, but both earlier and later manifestations exist. Although traditionally attributed to the foundations of quantum mechanics, the geometric phase has been generalized and become increasingly influential in many areas from condensed-matter physics and optics to high-energy and particle physics and from fluid mechanics to gravity and cosmology. Interestingly, the geometric phase also offers unique opportunities for quantum information and computation. In this Review, we first introduce the Aharonov–Bohm effect as an important realization of the geometric phase. Then, we discuss in detail the broader meaning, consequences and realizations of the geometric phase, emphasizing the most important mathematical methods and experimental techniques used in the study of the geometric phase, in particular those related to recent works in optics and condensed-matter physics.},

We show how an approximate gauge potential can be systematically built up as a series of nested commutators, remaining well-defined in the thermodynamic limit. Furthermore, the resulting CD driving protocols can be realized up to arbitrary order without leaving the available control space using tools from periodically-driven (Floquet) systems. This is illustrated on few- and many-body quantum systems, where the resulting Floquet protocols significantly suppress dissipation and provide a drastic increase in fidelity.},

Such driving in principle allows one to realize arbitrarily fast annealing protocols or implement fast dissipationless driving, circumventing standard adiabatic limitations requiring infinitesimally slow rates. These ideas were tested and used both experimentally and theoretically in small systems, but in larger chaotic systems, it is known that exact counterdiabatic protocols do not exist. In this work, we develop a simple variational approach allowing one to find the best possible counterdiabatic protocols given physical constraints, like locality. These protocols are easy to derive and implement both experimentally and numerically. We show that, using these approximate protocols, one can drastically suppress heating and increase fidelity of quantum annealing protocols in complex many-particle systems. In the fast limit, these protocols provide an effective dual description of adiabatic dynamics, where the coupling constant plays the role of time and the counterdiabatic term plays the role of the Hamiltonian.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The space of controllable parameters of isolated quantum many-body systems is endowed with a Riemannian quantum metric structure, which can be exploited when such systems are driven adiabatically. Here, we use this metric structure to construct optimal protocols in order to accomplish the task of adiabatic ground-state preparation in a fixed amount of time. Such optimal protocols are shown to be geodesics on the parameter manifold, maximizing the local fidelity. Physically, such protocols minimize the average energy fluctuations along the path. Our findings are illustrated on the Landau-Zener model and the anisotropic XY spin chain. In both cases we show that geodesic protocols drastically improve the final fidelity.

The Krylov basis spans the minimal operator subspace in which the dynamics unfolds and provides an efficient way to construct the counterdiabatic term. We apply our strategy to paradigmatic single and many-particle models.

The vibronic levels are classified by a quantum number, which in certain cases is formally related to the combined angular momentum of electronic and vibrational motion, and numerical values are obtained for the energies of these levels as functions of this quantum number and a dimensionless parameter measuring the magnitude of the electronic-vibrational coupling. It is shown that the selection rules for transitions from these vibronic levels to those of a non-degenerate electronic state allow changes in vibrational energy of any integral number of quanta, as though the Jahn-Teller effect were equivalent to a distortion which makes allowed vibrational transitions which would otherwise be forbidden. Numerical values are given for the oscillator strengths of vibronic absorption or emission bands involving transitions between a Jahn-Teller distorted state and an electronically non-degenerate state. It is found that in transitions from the latter to the former the vibrational structure of the electronic band exhibits two intensity maxima if the distortion is large.},

The quantum wave function can sometimes tunnel through significant obstacles. However it can also sometimes get stuck in local minima, even for fairly simple problems. An initial Hamiltonian which insufficiently mixes computational basis states is analogous to a poorly mixing Markov transition rule. We study a physical system -- the Ising quantum chain with alternating sector interaction defects, but constant transverse field -- which is equivalent to applying the quantum adiabatic algorithm to a particular SAT problem. We prove that for a constant range of values for the transverse field, the spectral gap is exponentially small in the sector length. Indeed, we prove that there are exponentially many eigenvalues all exponentially close to the ground state energy. Applying the adiabatic theorem therefore takes exponential time, even for this simple problem.},

Standard measures of chaos in quantum many-body systems are level statistics and the spectral form factor. In this work, we show that the norm of the adiabatic gauge potential, the generator of adiabatic deformations between eigenstates, serves as a much more sensitive measure of quantum chaos. We are able to detect transitions from integrable to chaotic behavior at perturbation strengths orders of magnitude smaller than those required for standard measures. Using this alternative probe in two generic classes of spin chains, we show that the chaotic threshold decreases exponentially with system size and that one can immediately detect integrability-breaking (chaotic) perturbations by analyzing infinitesimal perturbations even at the integrable point. In some cases, small integrability breaking is shown to lead to anomalously slow relaxation of the system, exponentially long in system size.},

A promising approach for their experimental realization in model systems is to adiabatically follow the ground state of a quantum Hamiltonian from a product state of isolated particles to one that is strongly-correlated. Such protocols are relevant also more broadly in coherent quantum annealing and adiabatic quantum computing. Here we explore one such protocol in a system of ultracold atoms in an optical lattice. A fully magnetized state is connected to a correlated zero-magnetization state (an xy-ferromagnet) by a many-body spin rotation, realized by sweeping the detuning and power of a microwave field. The efficiency is characterized by applying a reverse sweep with a variable relative phase. We restore up to 50\% of the original magnetization independent of the relative phase, evidence for the formation of correlations. The protocol is limited by the many-body gap of the final state, which is inversely proportional to system size, and technical noise.

	copyright = {© Francesco Petiziol, 2020},
	url = {https://www.repository.unipr.it/handle/1889/4010},
	abstract = {The challenge to fully grasp and to harness the bizarre phenomena which take place in the quantum realm is crucially linked to the ability to engineer and manipulate quantum systems with high precision. The scientific progress in this direction is opening new routes for the investigation of fundamental quantum physics, and it is at the same time paving the way to the development of the first quantum technologies.  
 
This thesis is dedicated to the search of strategies for high-fidelity and noise-tolerant quantum control. 
A versatile theoretical framework is set up for the design of optimized control protocols based on accelerated adiabatic processes. The benefits of the adiabatic dynamics, rooted in its intrinsic stability versus control imperfections, are released from the requirement of slow evolution: this is achieved thanks to the theoretical construction of accelerating control Hamiltonians which dynamically counteract deviations from the target dynamics. Our framework provides a methodical way to engineer these Hamiltonians by introducing fast modulations of the initially-available control parameters, and it results from the interplay between the theory of counterdiabatic fields and Floquet-Magnus average Hamiltonian theory. As compared to other shortcut-to-adiabaticity strategies, our control method keeps the system always close to the exact adiabatic path while not requiring the implementation of new Hamiltonian couplings. Moreover, the flexibility in the construction of the accelerating Hamiltonians offers a fertile ground for the hybridization with optimal control techniques. 
 
The general setup is applied to exemplary control problems of relevance in quantum optics and quantum information processing. First, a protocol is designed for the generation of entanglement between effective two-level systems coupled through a transmission line, in the experimental context of circuit quantum electrodynamics. Second, an accelerated version of the widespread technique of stimulated Raman adiabatic passage is presented, which dramatically enlarges its range of applicability for implementations both in the optical and in the microwave regime. 
 
The results strongly support the potential of the quantum control framework developed in this thesis. In particular, our methodology offers the opportunity to flank high fidelities and small error sensitivity with on-demand adaptability to experimental constraints and the flexibility for integrations with other control techniques. This makes it a valuable resource for applications in many branches of quantum science, with a natural outlet in quantum computation and simulation.},

	abstract = {This review gives a pedagogical introduction to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), its basis, and its implications to statistical mechanics and thermodynamics. In the first part, ETH is introduced as a natural extension of ideas from quantum chaos and random matrix theory (RMT). To this end, we present a brief overview of classical and quantum chaos, as well as RMT and some of its most important predictions. The latter include the statistics of energy levels, eigenstate components, and matrix elements of observables. Building on these, we introduce the ETH and show that it allows one to describe thermalization in isolated chaotic systems without invoking the notion of an external bath. We examine numerical evidence of eigenstate thermalization from studies of many-body lattice systems. We also introduce the concept of a quench as a means of taking isolated systems out of equilibrium, and discuss results of numerical experiments on quantum quenches. The second part of the review explores the implications of quantum chaos and ETH to thermodynamics. Basic thermodynamic relations are derived, including the second law of thermodynamics, the fundamental thermodynamic relation, fluctuation theorems, the fluctuation–dissipation relation, and the Einstein and Onsager relations. In particular, it is shown that quantum chaos allows one to prove these relations for individual Hamiltonian eigenstates and thus extend them to arbitrary stationary statistical ensembles. In some cases, it is possible to extend their regimes of applicability beyond the standard thermal equilibrium domain. We then show how one can use these relations to obtain nontrivial universal energy distributions in continuously driven systems. At the end of the review, we briefly discuss the relaxation dynamics and description after relaxation of integrable quantum systems, for which ETH is violated. We present results from numerical experiments and analytical studies of quantum quenches at integrability. We introduce the concept of the generalized Gibbs ensemble and discuss its connection with ideas of prethermalization in weakly interacting systems.},

The shortcuts are designed by a set of analytical and numerical methods suitable for different systems and conditions.

Thus shortcuts to adiabaticity have become instrumental in preparing and driving internal and motional states in atomic, molecular, and solid-state physics. Applications range from information transfer and processing based on gates or analog paradigms to interferometry and metrology. The multiplicity of STA paths for the controlling parameters may be used to enhance robustness versus noise and perturbations or to optimize relevant variables. Since adiabaticity is a widespread phenomenon, STA methods also extended beyond the quantum world to optical devices, classical mechanical systems, and statistical physics. Shortcuts to adiabaticity combine well with other concepts and techniques, in particular, with optimal control theory, and pose fundamental scientific and engineering questions such as finding speed limits, quantifying the third law, or determining process energy costs and efficiencies.

	abstract = {The introduction of control theory in quantum mechanics has created a rich, new interdisciplinary scientific field, which is producing novel insight into important theoretical questions at the heart of quantum physics. Exploring this emerging subject, Introduction to Quantum Control and Dynamics presents the mathematical concepts and fundamental physics behind the analysis and control of quantum dynamics, emphasizing the application of Lie algebra and Lie group theory.

To advantage students, instructors and practitioners, and since the field is highly interdisciplinary, this book presents an introduction with all the basic notions in the same place. The field has seen a large development in parallel with the neighboring fields of quantum information, computation and communication. The author has maintained an introductory level to encourage course use.

After introducing the basics of quantum mechanics, the book derives a class of models for quantum control systems from fundamental physics. It examines the controllability and observability of quantum systems and the related problem of quantum state determination and measurement. The author also uses Lie group decompositions as tools to analyze dynamics and to design control algorithms. In addition, he describes various other control methods and discusses topics in quantum information theory that include entanglement and entanglement dynamics.

	abstract = {One of the main theoretical challenges in quantum computing is the design of explicit schemes that enable one to effectively factorize a given final unitary operator into a product of basic unitary operators. As this is equivalent to a constructive controllability task on a Lie group of special unitary operators, one faces interesting classes of bilinear optimal control problems for which efficient numerical solution algorithms are sought for. In this paper we give a review on recent Lie-theoretical developments in finite-dimensional quantum control that play a key role for solving such factorization problems on a compact Lie group. After a brief introduction to basic terms and concepts from quantum mechanics, we address the fundamental control theoretic issues for bilinear control systems and survey standard techniques fromLie theory relevant for quantum control. Questions of controllability, accessibility and time optimal control of spin systems are in the center of our interest. Some remarks on computational aspects are included as well. The idea is to enable the potential reader to understand the problems in clear mathematical terms, to assess the current state of the art and get an overview on recent developments in quantum control-an emerging interdisciplinary field between physics, control and computation.

In some aerospace problems large savings in cost could be obtained with a small improvement in performance so that optimal operation became very important. As techniques were developed which were practical for computation and implementation of optimal controls the use of this theory became common in a large number of fields.

Bellman in the early 1950s, is a mathematical technique for making a sequence of interrelated decisions, which can be applied to many optimization problems (including optimal control problems). The basic idea of this method applied to optimal controls is to consider a family of optimal control problems with different initial times and states, to establish relationships among these problems via the so-called Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation (HJB, for short), which is a nonlinear first-order (in the deterministic case) or second-order (in the stochastic case) partial differential equation. If the HJB equation is solvable (either analytically or numerically), then one can obtain an optimal feedback control by taking the maximizer/minimizer of the Hamiltonian or generalized Hamiltonian involved in the HJB equation. This is the so-called verification technique. Note that this approach actually gives solutions to the whole family of problems (with different initial times and states), and in particular, the original problem.},

	abstract = {Quantum control is concerned with active manipulation of physical and chemical processes on the atomic and molecular scale. This work presents a perspective of progress in the field of control over quantum phenomena, tracing the evolution of theoretical concepts and experimental methods from early developments to the most recent advances. Among numerous theoretical insights and technological improvements that produced the present state-of-the-art in quantum control, there have been several breakthroughs of foremost importance. On the technology side, the current experimental successes would be impossible without the development of intense femtosecond laser sources and pulse shapers. On the theory side, the two most critical insights were (i) realizing that ultrafast atomic and molecular dynamics can be controlled via manipulation of quantum interferences and (ii) understanding that optimally shaped ultrafast laser pulses are the most effective means for producing the desired quantum interference patterns in the controlled system. Finally, these theoretical and experimental advances were brought together by the crucial concept of adaptive feedback control (AFC), which is a laboratory procedure employing measurement-driven, closed-loop optimization to identify the best shapes of femtosecond laser control pulses for steering quantum dynamics towards the desired objective. Optimization in AFC experiments is guided by a learning algorithm, with stochastic methods proving to be especially effective. AFC of quantum phenomena has found numerous applications in many areas of the physical and chemical sciences, and this paper reviews the extensive experiments. Other subjects discussed include quantum optimal control theory, quantum control landscapes, the role of theoretical control designs in experimental realizations and real-time quantum feedback control. The paper concludes with a perspective of open research directions that are likely to attract significant attention in the future.},

	abstract = {Accurate derivatives are important for locally traversing and converging efficiently in quantum optimization landscapes. By deriving analytically exact control derivatives (gradient and Hessian) for unitary control tasks, we show here that the computational feasibility of meeting this accuracy requirement depends on the choice of propagation scheme and problem representation. Even when exact propagation is sufficiently cheap it is, perhaps surprisingly, much more efficient to optimize the (appropriately) approximate propagators: Approximations in the dynamics are traded off for significant complexity reductions in the exact derivative calculations. Importantly, past the initial analytical considerations, only standard numerical techniques are explicitly required with straightforward application to realistic systems. These results are numerically verified for two concrete problems of increasing Hilbert space dimensionality. The best schemes obtain unit fidelity to machine precision, whereas the results for other schemes are separated consistently by orders of magnitude in computation time and in worst-case ten orders of magnitude in achievable fidelity. Since these gaps continually increase with system size and complexity, this methodology allows numerically efficient optimization of very high-dimensional dynamics, e.g., in many-body contexts, operating in the high-fidelity regime.},

	abstract = {In quantum optimal control theory the success of an optimization algorithm is highly influenced by how the figure of merit to be optimized behaves as a function of the control field, i.e., by the control landscape. Constraints on the control field introduce local minima in the landscape—false traps—which might prevent an efficient solution of the optimal control problem. Rabitz et al. [Science 303, 1998 (2004)] showed that local minima occur only rarely for unconstrained optimization. Here, we extend this result to the case of bandwidth-limited control pulses showing that in this case one can eliminate the false traps arising from the constraint. Based on this theoretical understanding, we modify the chopped-random-basis (CRAB) optimal control algorithm and show that this development exploits the advantages of both (unconstrained) gradient algorithms and of truncated basis methods, allowing one to always follow the gradient of the unconstrained landscape by bandwidth-limited control functions. We study the effects of additional constraints and show that for reasonable constraints the convergence properties are still maintained. Finally, we numerically show that this approach saturates the theoretical bound on the minimal bandwidth of the control needed to optimally drive the system.},

A promising approach for their experimental realization in model systems is to adiabatically follow the ground state of a quantum Hamiltonian from a product state of isolated particles to one that is strongly-correlated. Such protocols are relevant also more broadly in coherent quantum annealing and adiabatic quantum computing. Here we explore one such protocol in a system of ultracold atoms in an optical lattice. A fully magnetized state is connected to a correlated zero-magnetization state (an xy-ferromagnet) by a many-body spin rotation, realized by sweeping the detuning and power of a microwave field. The efficiency is characterized by applying a reverse sweep with a variable relative phase. We restore up to of the original magnetization independent of the relative phase, evidence for the formation of correlations. The protocol is limited by the many-body gap of the final state, which is inversely proportional to system size, and technical noise. Our experimental and theoretical studies highlight the potential and challenges for adiabatic preparation protocols to prepare many-body eigenstates of spin Hamiltonians.},

	abstract = {Gradient ascent pulse engineering algorithm (GRAPE) is a typical method to solve quantum optimal control problems. However, it suffers from an exponential resource in computing the time evolution of quantum systems with the increasing number of qubits, which is a barrier for its application in large-qubit systems. To mitigate this issue, we propose an iterative GRAPE algorithm (iGRAPE) for preparing a desired quantum state, where the large-scale, resource-consuming optimization problem is decomposed into a set of lower-dimensional optimization subproblems by disentanglement operations. Consequently these subproblems can be solved in parallel with less computing resources. For physical platforms such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and superconducting quantum systems, we show that iGRAPE can provide up to 13-fold speedup over GRAPE when preparing desired quantum states in systems within 12 qubits. Using a four-qubit NMR system, we also experimentally verify the feasibility of the iGRAPE algorithm.},

It includes, in addition to nonlinear equations of motion, control problems that are characterized by non-unitary time evolution, nonlinear dependencies of the Hamiltonian on the control, time-dependent targets, and optimization functionals that depend to higher than second order on the time-evolving states. We furthermore show that the nonlinear (second order) contribution can be estimated either analytically or numerically, yielding readily applicable optimization algorithms. We demonstrate monotonic convergence for an optimization functional that is an eighth-degree polynomial in the states. For the “standard” quantum control problem of a convex final-time functional, linear equations of motion and linear dependency of the Hamiltonian on the field, the second-order contribution is not required for monotonic convergence but can be used to speed up convergence. We demonstrate this by comparing the performance of first- and second-order algorithms for two examples.},

Pulse sequences that accomplish a desired transfer should be as short as possible in order to minimize the effects of relaxation and to optimize the sensitivity of the experiments. Here, we give an analytical characterization of such time optimal pulse sequences applicable to coherence transfer experiments in multiple-spin systems. We have adopted a general mathematical formulation, and present many of our results in this setting, mindful of the fact that new structures in optimal pulse design are constantly arising. From a general control theory perspective, the problems we want to study have the following character. Suppose we are given a controllable right invariant system on a compact Lie group. What is the minimum time required to steer the system from some initial point to a specified final point? In nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and quantum computing, this translates to, what is the minimum time required to produce a unitary propagator?

	abstract = {Effectively manipulating quantum computing (QC) hardware in the presence of imperfect devices and control systems is a central challenge in realizing useful quantum computers. Susceptibility to noise critically limits the performance and capabilities of today’s so-called noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, as well as any future QC technologies. Fortunately, quantum control enables efficient execution of quantum logic operations and quantum algorithms with built-in robustness to errors, and without the need for complex logical encoding. In this manuscript we introduce software tools for the application and integration of quantum control in QC research, serving the needs of hardware R\&D teams, algorithm developers, and end users. We provide an overview of a set of Python-based classical software tools for creating and deploying optimized quantum control solutions at various layers of the QC software stack. We describe a software architecture leveraging both high-performance distributed cloud computation and local custom integration into hardware systems, and explain how key functionality is integrable with other software packages and quantum programming languages. Our presentation includes a detailed mathematical overview of key features including a flexible optimization toolkit, engineering-inspired filter functions for analyzing noise susceptibility in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces, and new approaches to noise and hardware characterization. Pseudocode is presented in order to elucidate common programming workflows for these tasks, and performance benchmarking is reported for numerically intensive tasks, highlighting the benefits of the selected cloud-compute architecture. Finally, we present a series of case studies demonstrating the application of quantum control solutions derived from these tools in real experimental settings using both trapped-ion and superconducting quantum computer hardware.},

In this work, we perform a comparative study on the efficacy of three reinforcement learning algorithms: tabular Q-learning, deep Q-learning, and policy gradient, as well as two non-machine-learning methods: stochastic gradient descent and Krotov algorithms, in the problem of preparing a desired quantum state. We found that overall, the deep Q-learning and policy gradient algorithms outperform others when the problem is discretized, e.g. allowing discrete values of control, and when the problem scales up. The reinforcement learning algorithms can also adaptively reduce the complexity of the control sequences, shortening the operation time and improving the fidelity.

Then their improved performance is exemplified in Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger state preparation on the nearest-neighbour Ising model. Finally, we also show the advantage over the usual quantum approximation optimization algorithm, in terms of fidelity with bounded time.

The demonstration reveals that the EPR program contradicts quantum mechanics even for the cases of perfect correlations. By perfect correlations is meant arrangements by which the result of the measurement on one particle can be predicted with certainty given the outcomes of measurements on the other particles of the system. This incompatibility with quantum mechanics is stronger than the one previously revealed for two‐particle systems by Bell’s inequality, where no contradiction arises at the level of perfect correlations. Both spin‐correlation and multiparticle interferometry examples are given of suitable three‐ and four‐particle arrangements, both at the gedanken and at the real experiment level.},

We reveal three instances of their promising potential: (i) they realize spin-orbit coupling, with the left-right leg degree of freedom playing the role of an effective spin, (ii) their energy bands and eigenstates exactly reproduce the topological chiral edge modes of two-dimensional Chern insulators, and (iii) they can be tailored to realize a topological phase transition from a trivial to a topological insulating phase. We propose realistic schemes to observe the chiral and topological properties of ladder systems with current optical lattice-based experiments.

	abstract = {Finite topologically nontrivial systems are characterized, among many other unique properties, by the presence of bound states at their physical edges. These topological edge modes can be distinguished from usual Shockley waves energetically, as their energies remain finite and in gap even when the boundaries of the system represent an effectively infinite and sharp energetic barrier. Theoretically, the existence of topological edge modes can be shown by means of the bulk-edge correspondence and topological invariants. On a clean one-dimensional lattice and reducible two-dimensional models, in either the commensurate or semi-infinite case, the edge modes can be essentially obtained analytically, as shown previously [Y. Hatsugai, Phys. Rev. Lett. 71, 3697 (1993); D. Hügel and B. Paredes, Phys. Rev. A 89, 023619 (2014)]. In this work, we put forward a method for obtaining the spectrum and wave functions of topological edge modes for arbitrary finite lattices, including the incommensurate case. A small number of parameters are easily determined numerically, with the form of the eigenstates remaining fully analytical. We also obtain the bulk modes in the finite system analytically and their associated eigenenergies, which lie within the infinite-size limit continuum. Our method is general and can be easily applied to obtain the properties of nontopological models and/or extended to include impurities. As an example, we consider a relevant case of an impurity located next to one edge of a one-dimensional system, equivalent to a softened boundary in a separable two-dimensional model. We show that a localized impurity can have a drastic effect on the original topological edge modes of the system. Using the periodic Harper and Hofstadter models to illustrate our method, we find that, on increasing the impurity strength, edge states can enter or exit the continuum, and a trivial Shockley state bound to the impurity may appear. The fate of the topological edge modes in the presence of impurities can be addressed by quenching the impurity strength. We find that at certain critical impurity strengths, the transition probability for a particle initially prepared in an edge mode to decay into the bulk exhibits discontinuities that mark the entry and exit points of edge modes from and into the bulk spectrum.},

In standing-wave cavities the atoms can form stable spatial gratings. Moreover, their asymptotic distribution is a Maxwell–Boltzmann whose effective temperature is controlled by the laser parameters. In this work we show that in a two-mode standing-wave cavity the stationary state possesses the same properties and phases of the generalized Hamiltonian mean field model in the canonical ensemble. This model has three equilibrium phases: a paramagnetic, a nematic, and a ferromagnetic one, which here correspond to different spatial orders of the atomic gas and can be detected by means of the light emitted by the cavities. We further discuss perspectives for investigating in this setup the ensemble inequivalence predicted for the generalized Hamiltonian mean field model.},

Such gases consist of bosonic atoms or molecules that interact via dipolar forces, and that are cooled below the quantum degeneracy temperature, typically in the nK range. When such a degenerate quantum gas is loaded into an optical lattice produced by standing waves of laser light, new kinds of physical phenomena occur. Then, these systems realize extended Hubbard-type models, and can be brought to a strongly correlated regime. The physical properties of such gases, dominated by the long-range, anisotropic dipole–dipole interactions, are discussed using the mean-field approximations and exact quantum Monte Carlo techniques (the worm algorithm).},

	abstract = {This Perspective addresses the often observed surprising ease of achieving optimal control of nonlinear phenomena in quantum and classical complex systems. The circumstances involved are wide-ranging, with scenarios including manipulation of atomic scale processes, maximization of chemical and material properties or synthesis yields, Nature’s optimization of species’ populations by natural selection, and directed evolution. Natural evolution will mainly be discussed in terms of laboratory experiments with microorganisms, and the field is also distinct from the other domains where a scientist specifies the goal(s) and oversees the control process. We use the word “control” in reference to all of the available variables, regardless of the circumstance. The empirical observations on the ease of achieving at least good, if not excellent, control in diverse domains of science raise the question of why this occurs despite the generally inherent complexity of the systems in each scenario. The key to addressing the question lies in examining the associated control landscape, which is defined as the optimization objective as a function of the control variables that can be as diverse as the phenomena under consideration. Controls may range from laser pulses, chemical reagents, chemical processing conditions, out to nucleic acids in the genome and more. This Perspective presents a conjecture, based on present findings, that the systematics of readily finding good outcomes from controlled phenomena may be unified through consideration of control landscapes with the same common set of three underlying assumptions─the existence of an optimal solution, the ability for local movement on the landscape, and the availability of sufficient control resources─whose validity needs assessment in each scenario. In practice, many cases permit using myopic gradient-like algorithms while other circumstances utilize algorithms having some elements of stochasticity or introduced noise, depending on whether the landscape is locally smooth or rough. The overarching observation is that only relatively short searches are required despite the common high dimensionality of the available controls in typical scenarios.},

The continuation is valid when the Hamiltonian has a gap, or else has a sufficiently small low-energy density of states, and thus is away from a quantum phase transition. This continuation takes local operators into local operators, while approximately preserving the ground-state expectation values. We apply this continuation to the problem of gauge theories coupled to matter, and propose the distinction of perimeter law versus “zero law” to identify confinement. We also apply the continuation to local bosonic models with emergent gauge theories. We show that local gauge invariance is topological and cannot be broken by any local perturbations in the bosonic models in either continuous or discrete gauge groups. We show that the ground-state degeneracy in emergent discrete gauge theories is a robust property of the bosonic model, and we argue that the robustness of local gauge invariance in the continuous case protects the gapless gauge boson.},

	abstract = {Gapped ground states of quantum spin systems have been referred to in the physics literature as being ‘in the same phase’ if there exists a family of Hamiltonians H(s), with finite range interactions depending continuously on \$\$\{s{\textbackslash}in [0,1]\}\$\$, such that for each s, H(s) has a non-vanishing gap above its ground state and with the two initial states being the ground states of H(0) and H(1), respectively. In this work, we give precise conditions under which any two gapped ground states of a given quantum spin system that ’belong to the same phase’ are automorphically equivalent and show that this equivalence can be implemented as a flow generated by an s-dependent interaction which decays faster than any power law (in fact, almost exponentially). The flow is constructed using Hastings’ ‘quasi-adiabatic evolution’ technique, of which we give a proof extended to infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. In addition, we derive a general result about the locality properties of the effect of perturbations of the dynamics for quantum systems with a quasi-local structure and prove that the flow, which we call the spectral flow, connecting the gapped ground states in the same phase, satisfies a Lieb-Robinson bound. As a result, we obtain that, in the thermodynamic limit, the spectral flow converges to a co-cycle of automorphisms of the algebra of quasi-local observables of the infinite spin system. This proves that the ground state phase structure is preserved along the curve of models H(s), 0 ≤ s ≤ 1.},

A scalable Ising machine that outperforms existing standard digital computers could have a huge impact for practical applications for a wide variety of optimization problems. In this review, we survey the current status of various approaches to constructing Ising machines and explain their underlying operational principles. The types of Ising machines considered here include classical thermal annealers based on technologies such as spintronics, optics, memristors, and digital hardware accelerators; dynamical-systems solvers implemented with optics and electronics; and superconducting-circuit quantum annealers. We compare and contrast their performance using standard metrics such as the ground-state success probability and time-to-solution, give their scaling relations with problem size, and discuss their strengths and weaknesses.},

It seems natural to harvest the remarkable properties of systems characterized by topological invariants to perform this task. Here, we show that a linear network of coupled bosonic degrees of freedom, characterized by topological bands, can be employed for the efficient exchange of quantum information over large distances. Important features of our setup are that it is robust against quenched disorder, all relevant operations can be performed by global variations of parameters, and the time required for communication between distant qubits approaches linear scaling with their distance. We demonstrate that our concept can be extended to an ensemble of qubits embedded in a two-dimensional network to allow for communication between all of them.},

Recently, it was proposed that a Gram-Schmidt-type algorithm can be used to explicitly evaluate the expression of the AGP. We employ a version of this approach by using the Lanczos algorithm to evaluate the AGP operator in terms of Krylov vectors and the AGP norm in terms of the Lanczos coefficients. It has the advantage of minimizing redundancies in evaluating the nested commutators in the analytic expression for the AGP operator. The algorithm is used to explicitly construct the AGP operator for some simple systems. We derive an integral transform relation between the AGP norm and the autocorrelation function of the deformation operator. We present a modification of the Variational approach to derive the regulated AGP norm. Using this, we approximate the AGP to varying degrees of success. Finally, we compare and contrast the quantum-chaos-probing capacities of the AGP and K-complexity in view of the Operator Growth Hypothesis.},

The field comprises four domains: quantum communication, where individual or entangled photons are used to transmit data in a provably secure way; quantum simulation, where well-controlled quantum systems are used to reproduce the behaviour of other, less accessible quantum systems; quantum computation, which employs quantum effects to dramatically speed up certain calculations, such as number factoring; and quantum sensing and metrology, where the high sensitivity of coherent quantum systems to external perturbations is exploited to enhance the performance of measurements of physical quantities.

	abstract = {Quantum adiabatic processes—that keep constant the populations in the instantaneous eigenbasis of a time-dependent Hamiltonian—are very useful to prepare and manipulate states, but take typically a long time. This is often problematic because decoherence and noise may spoil the desired final state, or because some applications require many repetitions. “Shortcuts to adiabaticity” are alternative fast processes which reproduce the same final populations, or even the same final state, as the adiabatic process in a finite, shorter time. Since adiabatic processes are ubiquitous, the shortcuts span a broad range of applications in atomic, molecular, and optical physics, such as fast transport of ions or neutral atoms, internal population control, and state preparation (for nuclear magnetic resonance or quantum information), cold atom expansions and other manipulations, cooling cycles, wavepacket splitting, and many-body state engineering or correlations microscopy. Shortcuts are also relevant to clarify fundamental questions such as a precise quantification of the third principle of thermodynamics and quantum speed limits. We review different theoretical techniques proposed to engineer the shortcuts, the experimental results, and the prospects.},

	abstract = {We propose digitized-counterdiabatic quantum optimization (DCQO) to achieve polynomial enhancement over adiabatic quantum optimization for the general Ising spin-glass model, which includes the whole class of combinatorial optimization problems. This is accomplished via the digitization of adiabatic quantum algorithms that are catalyzed by the addition of nonstoquastic counterdiabatic terms. The latter is suitably chosen not only for escaping classical simulability, but also for speeding up the performance. Finding the ground state of a general Ising spin-glass Hamiltonian is used to illustrate that the inclusion of k-local nonstoquastic counterdiabatic terms can always outperform the traditional adiabatic quantum optimization with stoquastic Hamiltonians. In particular, we show that a polynomial enhancement in the ground-state success probability can be achieved for a finite-time evolution, even with the simplest two-local counterdiabatic terms. Furthermore, the considered digitization process within the gate-based quantum computing paradigm, provides the flexibility to introduce arbitrary nonstoquastic interactions. As an experimental test, we study the performance of the DCQO algorithm on cloud-based IBM's superconducting and Quantinuum's ion-trap quantum processors with up to 8 qubits. Along these lines, using our proposed paradigm on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers, quantum speedup may be reached to find approximate solutions for NP-complete and NP-hard optimization problems. We expect DCQO to become a fast-lane paradigm toward quantum advantage in the NISQ era.},

In this work, we implement cutting-edge reinforcement learning (RL) techniques and show that their performance is comparable to optimal control methods in the task of finding short, high-fidelity driving protocol from an initial to a target state in nonintegrable many-body quantum systems of interacting qubits. RL methods learn about the underlying physical system solely through a single scalar reward (the fidelity of the resulting state) calculated from numerical simulations of the physical system. We further show that quantum-state manipulation viewed as an optimization problem exhibits a spin-glass-like phase transition in the space of protocols as a function of the protocol duration. Our RL-aided approach helps identify variational protocols with nearly optimal fidelity, even in the glassy phase, where optimal state manipulation is exponentially hard.

We propose a generalized QAOA called CD-QAOA, which is inspired by the counterdiabatic driving procedure, designed for quantum many-body systems and optimized using a reinforcement learning (RL) approach. The resulting hybrid control algorithm proves versatile in preparing the ground state of quantum-chaotic many-body spin chains by minimizing the energy. We show that using terms occurring in the adiabatic gauge potential as generators of additional control unitaries, it is possible to achieve fast high-fidelity many-body control away from the adiabatic regime. While each unitary retains the conventional QAOA-intrinsic continuous control degree of freedom such as the time duration, we consider the order of the multiple available unitaries appearing in the control sequence as an additional discrete optimization problem. Endowing the policy gradient algorithm with an autoregressive deep learning architecture to capture causality, we train the RL agent to construct optimal sequences of unitaries. The algorithm has no access to the quantum state, and we find that the protocol learned on small systems may generalize to larger systems. By scanning a range of protocol durations, we present numerical evidence for a finite quantum speed limit in the nonintegrable mixed-field spin-1/2 Ising and Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick models, and for the suitability to prepare ground states of the spin-1 Heisenberg chain in the long-range and topologically ordered parameter regimes.

Moreover, it has been shown that WVA-based metrology can reach the Heisenberg limit using entangled resources, but preparing macroscopic entangled resources remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate a novel WVA scheme based on iterative interactions, achieving the Heisenberg-limited precision scaling without resorting to entanglement. This indicates that the perceived advantages of the entanglement-assisted WVA are in fact due to iterative interactions between each particle of an entangled system and a meter, rather than coming from the entanglement itself.

	abstract = {In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

	abstract = {Owing to the enormous interest the rapidly growing field of topological states of matter (TSM) has attracted in recent years, the main focus of this review is on the theoretical foundations of TSM. Starting from the adiabatic theorem of quantum mechanics which we present from a geometrical perspective, the concept of TSM is introduced to distinguish gapped many body ground states that have representatives within the class of non-interacting systems and mean field superconductors, respectively, regarding their global geometrical features. These classifying features are topological invariants defined in terms of the adiabatic curvature of these bulk insulating systems. We review the general classification of TSM in all symmetry classes in the framework of K-Theory. Furthermore, we outline how interactions and disorder can be included into the theoretical framework of TSM by reformulating the relevant topological invariants in terms of the single particle Green's function and by introducing twisted boundary conditions, respectively. We finally integrate the field of TSM into a broader context by distinguishing TSM from the concept of topological order which has been introduced to study fractional quantum Hall systems.

The ultimate goal in quantum control is to prepare a desired state with the highest fidelity allowed by the available resources and the experimental constraints. Here we experimentally implement two optimal high-fidelity control protocols using a two-level quantum system comprising Bose–Einstein condensates in optical lattices. The first is a short-cut protocol that reaches the maximum quantum-transformation speed compatible with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. In the opposite limit, we realize the recently proposed transitionless superadiabatic protocols in which the system follows the instantaneous adiabatic ground state nearly perfectly. We demonstrate that superadiabatic protocols are extremely robust against control parameter variations, making them useful for practical applications.},

Understanding the structure of these transformations and identifying the systems for which such transformations can be performed efficiently and quickly is therefore of primary importance. In this paper we focus on finding optimal paths in the space of couplings controlling the system's Hamiltonian. More specifically, starting from a local Hamiltonian we analyze directions in the space of couplings along which adiabatic transformations can be accurately generated by local operators, which are both realizable in experiments and easy to simulate numerically. We consider a nonintegrable 1D Ising model parametrized by two independent couplings, corresponding to longitudinal and transverse magnetic fields. We find regions in the space of couplings characterized by a very strong anisotropy of the variational adiabatic gauge potential (AGP), generating the adiabatic transformations, which allows us to define optimal adiabatic paths. We find that these paths generally terminate at singular points characterized by extensive degeneracies in the energy spectrum, splitting the parameter space into adiabatically disconnected regions. The anisotropy follows from singularities in the AGP, and we identify special robust weakly thermalizing and nonabsorbing many-body “dark” states which are annihilated by the singular part of the AGP and show that their existence extends deep into the ergodic regime.},

Counterdiabatic (CD) approaches, which use knowledge of the underlying system Hamiltonian to actively correct for diabatic effects, are powerful tools for achieving simultaneously fast and stable state transformations. Protocols for CD driving have thus far been limited in their experimental implementation to discrete systems with just two or three levels, as well as bulk systems with scaling symmetries. Here, we extend the tool of CD control to a discrete synthetic lattice system composed of as many as nine sites. Although this system has a vanishing gap and thus no adiabatic support in the thermodynamic limit, we show that CD approaches can still give a substantial improvement in fidelity over naive, fast protocols.},

            We quantitatively assess the energetic cost of several well-known control protocols that achieve a finite time adiabatic dynamics, namely counterdiabatic and local counterdiabatic driving, optimal control, and inverse engineering. By employing a cost measure based on the norm of the total driving Hamiltonian, we show that a hierarchy of costs emerges that is dependent on the protocol duration. As case studies we explore the Landau–Zener model, the quantum harmonic oscillator, and the Jaynes–Cummings model and establish that qualitatively similar results hold in all cases. For the analytically tractable Landau–Zener case, we further relate the effectiveness of a control protocol with the spectral features of the new driving Hamiltonians and show that in the case of counterdiabatic driving, it is possible to further minimize the cost by optimizing the ramp.},
