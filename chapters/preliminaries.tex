    \section{Quantum Adiabaticity}
        Much of the motivation for the work presented in this thesis relies on a good understanding the idea of a quantum adiabatic process. While in classical thermodynamics, an adiabatic process i

        Starting
        from the seminal work of Berry on the geometric phase \cite{berry_transitionless_2009}, it was recognized
        that adiabaticity is intimately related to geometric aspects of the state space of a quantum system \cite{kolodrubetz_geometry_2017}, and hence it is nowadays often presented with emphasis
        on a geometric angle.
