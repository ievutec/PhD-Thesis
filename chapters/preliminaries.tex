    \section{Quantum Adiabaticity}
        The concept of quantum adiabaticity is the central starting point of the work presented in this thesis. 
        
        Much of the motivation for the work presented in this thesis relies on a good understanding of what a quantum adiabatic process is. While in classical thermodynamics, an adiabatic process is essentially one where no heat or mass is transferred between a system and its environment, the quantum adiabatic theorem concerns itself more with the speed at which changes in a driven system Hamiltonian occur
