Quantum systems are notoriously volatile creatures. In our quest to build better quantum technologies, we must first learn the art of \emph{controlling} them with very high precision in a way that produces useful information or work. This must be done while protecting the information such systems contain from an environment that is often hell-bent on making this job as difficult as possible (note that this anthropomorphisation of quantum systems and the environment is for literary effect - I do not believe that the environment has much in the way of an agenda to inflict decoherence upon quantum systems).

A particularly useful type of controlled process that we would like to be able to perform is an \emph{adiabatic} process, which involves slowly changing some parameter affecting a quantum system, \@e.g.~the strength or direction of an electromagnetic field. The `slow' part here is required to keep the system from getting excited out of the `instantaneous' energy level that it starts in. Think of slowly rotating a magnetic field such that a magnet always stays aligned with the field. If the change happens too quickly, the magnet overshoots in the direction of the changing field. An analogous process happens in the quantum case, where the quantum state `jumps' out of its energy level. For many applications of quantum technologies, we would like to avoid such jumps, hence we perform adiabatic (slow) transformations.

Unfortunately, the volatility of quantum systems does not often allow us to abide by this slow condition. The longer a quantum process takes to complete, the more time it spends exposed to the environment, leaking information and absorbing heat. In order to combat this lossiness, entire fields of study have been developed with the sole aim of imitating the results of adiabatic processes on shorter timescales. The techniques used to achieve this vary vastly and achieve various levels of success: some suppress the losses that come with fast processes, others try to avoid them entirely with increasingly complex protocols.

In this thesis, we present a method which aims to speed up adiabatic processes in a way that caters to the practical constraints of quantum experiments. We assume that we are given a limited set of operations we can perform in order to suppress some of the non-adiabatic jumps that occur during fast driving. We then optimise the path through which the system travels during that time in a way that
