\epigraph{“With magic, you can turn a frog into a prince. With science, you can turn a frog into a Ph.D and you still have the frog you started with.”}{Terry Pratchett}

At the moment, this is full of quotes from Star Trek I'd like to use:

\begin{itemize}
    \item "A library serves no purpose unless someone is using it." Mr. Atoz, "All Our Yesterdays"
    \item "Computers make excellent and efficient servants, but I have no wish to serve under them." Mr. Spock, "The Ultimate Computer"
    \item "Insufficient facts always invite danger." Mr. Spock, "Space Seed"
    \item "Change is the essential process of all existence." Mr. Spock, "Let That Be Your Last Battlefield"
    \item "Instruments register only through things they're designed to register. Space still contains infinite unknowns." Mr. Spock, "The Naked Time"
\end{itemize}

And now for some Terry Pratchett:

\begin{itemize}
    \item “Sometimes scientists change their minds. New developments cause a rethink. If this bothers you, consider how much damage is being done to the world by people for whom new developments do not cause a rethink.”

\end{itemize}
